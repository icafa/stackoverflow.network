https://github.com/TruStory/truchain
TruStory's truchain is finished ?
Or it can be used for application development?
It says application specific blockchain on github with less delays, how does it work in detail?
It has 2000+ commits, what's this for?
It can be used as a starter project for application development?

hey trustory closed up shop a couple months ago. they did open source all their work. Yes you are free to use that code as a starting point, I am not sure which verion of the sdk it is using so it may need some updating

My idea is quite similar to this and is there anyone who know why TruStory closed their shop?
If it's not the fault of idea itself, I am going to continue on this

:man_shrugging:
not much usage I guess
AFAIK the code is open source
