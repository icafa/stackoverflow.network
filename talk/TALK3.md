I see
But you know how it works right?
Want to discuss if my idea is possible
I was talking to my colleague and got an idea
We are a development community which manages reputation.
The main thing that make our platform different is that developers get benefits.

We look after developers. There can be a case of a reputational developer require money.
We can borrow money to him/her according to his reputation.
He can return money in BTC or USDT after getting some jobs or return it from his pocket later time when he get from outside or from his friend.
Community believe in trusted developers.
Also community can give paid community projects to developers so that he/she can pay back the money.
But he needs to give +10% when he return as it's a business.
Most of DeFi system uses BTC or ETH or USDT as collateral, but actually if someone need money, he doesn't have BTC or ETH
But he can have trust from the community if he has high reputation
The reputation is not easy to get, it is not buyable from money
It's got from very long hours of effort and it's precious to anyone.
If someone get 10000 reputation over 1 year, he will not go away with $1000.
If he go away, he will lose whole reputation he stacked for 1 year
Do you think this idea could be working?

It's a credit rating system
Someone will make that work some day

But there's nothing similar to it right now right?
All the work will be done using blockchain
on cosmos network

There are probably 100 projects like it with no traction
