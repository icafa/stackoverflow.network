A few questions:
-Why would a user choose to use this service instead of StackOverflow?

- Gopher JK, May 20, 2020at 4:56 PM
We provide lending/ borrowing service additionally
High reputation users have ability to borrow from community
It's a similar to credit rating system
Rating is managed by reputation
Do you have a vision for blockchain credit rating system?

- Andy B, May 20, 2020 at 5:00 PM
Why not use a StackOverflow API to determine rep? Why compete with an entire 10s of millions of $ social platform to do lending?

- Gopher JK, May 20, 2020 at 5:04 PM
The most important thing is to push open source projects within community level
Stackoverflow is not supporting opensource, but just supporting simple issue solve
But we will provide more opportunity for users to get reputation via open source contribution
Open source contributers does not get reputation from stackoverflow
And also generally, developer's reputation is managed on several places
We want to manage developer's reputation in 1 place, and calculate credit rating from the reputation
Also we will be providing matching between developers and clients

So you want to build StackOverflow+Github+Maker combined into one?
And a jobs portal?

- Gopher JK, May 20, 2020 at 5:06 PM
It's similar
on top of cosmos blockchain
yeah
For initial users, we will give reputation by stackoverflow reputation
If they claim reputation on our platform, we will verify their reputation and give our reputation to them

I would need to see an MVP and a technical team that can deliver that massive massive vision before I can contribute to this project.

- Gopher JK, May 20, 2020 at 5:08 PM
They will have their own user id on our platform
What I want from you right now is to build a white paper according to understanding of so far.
And I will find more developers using the white paper
