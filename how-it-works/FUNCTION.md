# How all reputation management works?

Most of rules will follow stackoverflow rules.
When you write good accepted answer, you will get +15.
When you get upvote, will get +10.
When you get downvote, will get +2.

There's a reputation bounty for hardly solvable problems.

We will have double upvote feature for which he really like.
He will take out his repuation for really like upvoting.
He will get -2 rep, other will get +20 point.

Own answer upvote will result in minus.
If you heart upvote on your own, you will get -22.
And if you upvote on your own, you will get -10.
But those icons will always be visible on your article.

If there's more than 5 hearts on that subject, first heart upvoted person get bonus reputation of +10 and the other upvoters get 2 reputation returned.

For competitions, there's bonus like +30 or +100 based on the importance of that competition in community level.

# Voting cost

We should think of voting cost, if voting is free, it can make lots of malicious users and we can't stop it.
If it's high, selfish person will not vote.
What will be most appropriate?

But it should fairly low to encourage guys to vote good ones.
