# Restriction and rules

- clean network with no video and ads

# Discord rules

- Do not harrass users in any way, shape, or form. This includes
    Un-necessary Mentions
        Tagging a random person for help
        Tagging someone multiple times within the same conversation
    DMs, notably, but not limited to
        Requesting support via DM
        Randomly asking personal questions via DM
        Looking for people to hire via DM
- Do not post scams, spam, or links unrelated to Cosmos or Cosmos-related projects
    You can post images, videos, pastebins, etc, as long as they are relevant to the discussion
    You can post most things in Off Topic, use your best judgement
- Do not post messages in multiple channels in quick succession
    Discord is not slack, people are automatically present in every channel
    If no one answers your question in one channel, or it's drowned by discussion, maybe repost somewhere else after a reasonable amount of time (30 minutes is on the low side, for reference)
    If someone tells you to move your question, it's fine to do it, too
- Do not post Not Safe For Work content
- Avoid discussion of politics, religion, or any non-Cosmos topics that can be reasonably considered controversial
- Do not have an offensive or sexually explicit nickname or profile picture, moderators will give you a nickname and ask you to change it when it is noticed
- Do read channel descriptions, they are effectively rules!
- Do use common sense, Moderators can take action at their own discretion if necessary
