# How all reputation management works?

Most of rules will follow stackoverflow rules.
When you write good accepted answer, you will get +15.
When you get upvote, will get +10.
When you get downvote, will get +2.

There's a reputation bounty for hardly solvable problems.

# Voting cost

We should think of voting cost, if voting is free, it can make lots of malicious users and we can't stop it.
If it's high, selfish person will not vote.
What will be most appropriate?

But it should fairly low to encourage guys to vote good ones.
