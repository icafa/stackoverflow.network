# Google search for "blockchain credit rating system" as Michael recommended

## What Is a Credit Rating?

A credit rating (= trust rating, trust level) is a quantified assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower in general terms or with respect to a particular debt or financial obligation. A credit rating can be assigned to any entity that seeks to borrow money—an individual, corporation, state or provincial authority, or sovereign government.

Individual credit is scored from by credit bureaus such as Experian and TransUnion on a three-digit numerical scale using a form of Fair Isaac (FICO) credit scoring. Credit assessment and evaluation for companies and governments is generally done by a credit rating agency such as Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's, or Fitch. These rating agencies are paid by the entity that is seeking a credit rating for itself or for one of its debt issues.

## Issue bond

A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental)
