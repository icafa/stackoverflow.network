@Gopher JK Tell me about your game/zone!

Idea is not finished yet, but basically what I am thinking is to build the developer network.
I will get initial users by giving them my tokens for free.
They can claim tokens by their stackoverflow account reputation.
I am not sure if I need to get agreement from stackoverflow team :)
After initial claim, I will be building reputation management system which runs on blockchain and build a job network.
And problem solving network. @Michael
Now I am thinking of how to connect my network with your game network.
What do you think about my idea?
I need advisors for this developer network project
The hardest part is to get initial funds - who will be giving funds to this network
Now, I am checking projects that provide similar services and modifying the structure and introducing something unique on my chain.
Please advise me and you will be my first advisors :slight_smile:

I'm not sure I really understand
What do the tokens enable?

- Gopher JK, May 15th 2020 at 3:57 PM  
Tokens are used for voting

- Michael, May 15th 2020 at 3:57 PM  
Voting on what?

- Gopher JK, May 15th 2020 at 3:57 PM  
Voting on other persons activity
It should be similar to stackoverflow
Stackoverflow is not related to money but our network members will be getting rewards regularly from the network by their reputation
Our community members will get reward from ATOM validators. Supporters of developer network will be validator of ATOM and they will put the whole rewards into the developer network and community members will split for some rules.
I will put my whole ATOM for this. Owners can leave any time if they don't like.
But I believe there will be guys who are similar to Novel.
