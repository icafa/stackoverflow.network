# Starter project research

- Recommendation from @Riccardo Montagnin, cosmos discord administrator.
https://github.com/cosmos/scaffold

- Tutorial projects; I used to use this for other cosmos projects as a starter project
https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-tutorials

- Review this in detail, how it's completed and if it can be used as starter project officially.
https://github.com/TruStory/

Review:
- This can be used as starter project officially, said by @Marko on cosmos discord.
- Website https://beta.trustory.io
- Architecture https://blog.cosmos.network/building-a-decentralized-app-with-cosmos-sdk-3c535cdc6a6a
- TruStory is a social network to debate ideas
- It has upvoting, downvoting features
- It has connection with twitter account
- It has coin staking feature with investing feature
- It gives 100 TRU token after sign up.
- It's using v0.34.4, need some time to put for upgrading
- Need to investigate time to see why they closed their shop, it's critical, we should know the reason before using this project as starter project.

- cloud computing; we can use this; but need to investigate time to check if it's useful; cosmos sdk is not old

- content monetization, attribution and distribution; cosmos sdk version is not old
https://github.com/likecoin/likecoin-chain

- encrypted data solution; cosmos sdk is latest
https://github.com/enigmampc/EnigmaBlockchain

Review:
- Master branch is just the cosmwasm running engine
- Developer branch is being actively developed and it has registration engine
- Documentation is quite good
- It does not seem to be something that can consider much, when writing documentation, can refer to their documentation styles.

- DeFi Kava
https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava
Review:
- They are building DeFi engine, their modules like auction, Bep3, CDP, Pricefeed are not something related to our reputation management project.
- But we can consider using this, when we are at DeFi stage.


- We need chat feature, consider this
https://github.com/SaifRehman/tendermint-chat-app
https://github.com/wolfposd/TMChat

- To consider while development; version is too old btw
https://github.com/forbole/forboled

- Review Lino network project github; cosmos sdk version is 0.37.0 not that old
https://github.com/lino-network/lino

- We need developer's guide repository like commercio
https://github.com/commercionetwork/commercio-developers-guide

- Most of teams have their own sdk, do we need this?

- We should fork cosmos-sdk in case we don't get the sdk support from tendermint

# We should use latest version of cosmos 0.38.x
