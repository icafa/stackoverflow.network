# Starter project research

- Recommendation from @Riccardo Montagnin, cosmos discord administrator.
https://github.com/cosmos/scaffold

- Tutorial projects; I used to use this for other cosmos projects as a starter project
https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-tutorials

- Review this in detail, how it's completed and if it can be used as starter project officially.

- cloud computing; we can use this; but need to investigate time to check if it's useful; cosmos sdk is not old
https://github.com/ovrclk/akash

- content monetization, attribution and distribution; cosmos sdk version is not old
https://github.com/likecoin/likecoin-chain

- encrypted data solution; cosmos sdk is latest
https://github.com/enigmampc/EnigmaBlockchain

- DeFi Kava
https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava


- We need chat feature, consider this
https://github.com/SaifRehman/tendermint-chat-app
https://github.com/wolfposd/TMChat

- To consider while development; version is too old btw
https://github.com/forbole/forboled

- Review Lino network project github; cosmos sdk version is 0.37.0 not that old
https://github.com/lino-network/lino

- We need developer's guide repository like commercio
https://github.com/commercionetwork/commercio-developers-guide

- Most of teams have their own sdk, do we need this?

- We should fork cosmos-sdk in case we don't get the sdk support from tendermint

# We should use latest version of cosmos 0.38.x
