It's good, can you tell me which part is related to our platform?
like reputation management?
There should be specific point in design that this is our platform :slight_smile:
We should emphasize something on cosmos
Please check our current logo; it does not look good but it has something to show at the center the "star"

the design has the meaning if you put a meaning into it. as I understand the project cosmos  is  you have to get the reputations, and the interest of your clients/workers  which means the value, hardworks, dedication will be put together to make it a good in the sight of everyone! I design that because I saw the functions of the project in that formations  the circle one shows unity and those stuffs like six hands thats the people who has random talents to work with. and thr circle in the middle is the core in which handling the project as a strong community. the background circle is like the galaxy very huge where the cosmos is moving.
I give it a new shape of cosmos because cosmos has no shape either in my research people  making their own perceptions means they cannot see it but they have the ability to shape it even they only use their senses. ofcourse sense of humors
a common sense
