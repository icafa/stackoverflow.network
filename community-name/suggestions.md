Cross-Chain Overflow

"Cross-Chain" because the word is more intuitive than "Cosmos" to new comers seeking answers to their questions about blockchains. I would imagine our platform would have questions and answers from various blockchains, not just Cosmos Network. Cross-chain interoperability is also the value proposition of the Cosmos Network so the name fits nicely.
"Overflow" because almost all developers know about StackOverflow, and these developers will immediately know what our platform initially does. As time and platform evolution progresses, developers will gradually associate the brand "Cross-Chain Overflow" to include credit rating, peer-to-peer loans marketplace and job board.

Interop Overflow

Similar reasoning as above but "Interop" is more broad and inclusive than "Cross-Chain", including non-blockchain related questions and answers.
Also, the initials is "IO", like input/output, which is pretty cool.

Quiver

A blank-slate name that is short and memorable. It starts with the letters "Qu" like in the word "Question". "Quiver" could be imaged as answer-seekers quiver with excitement when their questions are answered, or when users get upvoted, or when users found their dream job. Our platform's mascot could be a gopher quivering or a stack of paper quivering or something quivering (while starting a new trend in having logos as a gif/animation).

Quest

Similar reasoning as above but for the quest for knowledge, quest in seeking answers, quest in seeking jobs.

Mempool Overflow

Asmodat's suggestion "Cosmos Mempool Overflow" is hilarious, memorable, and most developers would immediately know what our platform is about because of the association with the brand "Stack Overflow".
"Mempool Overflow" is just shorter, and the initials "MO" is highly meme-able. e.g. MONEY, MORE MONEY, MOR, MORRR
Here's a logo to go along with "Mempool Overflow" :rofl:
