# Reputation is backed by tokens which has value.

Our platform/community is guaranteeing a person with his reputation which is backed by our token which has value.
And it can be used as collateral in job hiring network.
We will be connecting with tons of hiring platforms where remote work is involved.

He/she will not easy to get reputation once he/she did a bad thing.
