# How to express our community better

We are a trust (reputation) based DeFi platform which connect enormous development community and clients, investors community.

# To win strategy the other companies until our platform is developed fully
- Should keep secret for all of ideas
- When hiring non-reputational writer, shouldn't give full idea yet.
- All the writing actions should be done top trusted writers.
- Our platform will take time to fully build in blockchain core, we will have to have temporary service to get initial users and investors to push development financially.

# Talk content

- When a developer change profile, it should be verified by more than 3 moderators.
- When a developer is verified via KYC, level rise up.
- There's reputation and also level.
- level can rise up when at least have some reputation.
- Anyone can create proposal to make platform better and there will be upvotes from guys to make it better.
- Reputation is not money. No one can buy reputation from money.
- Reputation can be used as collateral to borrow money.
- For example if someone earned 10k reputation over 1 year, he can borrow $1000.
- Details will be discussed with our advisors.
- When return, there should be additional money.
- When we think of this, we can finally be a New Defi, which reputation is used as collateral.
- Now only BTC, ETH like things are used as collateral but we are reputation based community and use it as collateral.
- Also for financial activities, investors should upvote for that. Community can't use money without upvotes. Especially for his personal projects.
Top trusted developers with top quality will be helping your projects.

- Benefit that investors get
As our community become bigger, community money will grow and it will generate more income.
And investors get top level service from moderators.

- Benefit that developers get
We look after developers. There can be a case of a reputational developer require money.
We can borrow money to him/her according to his reputation.
He can return money in BTC or USDT after getting some jobs or return it from his pocket later time when he get from outside or from his friend.
Community believe in trusted developers.
Also community can give paid community projects to developers so that he/she can pay back the money.
But he needs to give +10% when he return as it's a business.

- Benefit that rich clients get
Rich clients get top quality work from community.
Community will provide reputational developers and testers to ensure quality.
From rich clients, we will get some more fees to give community members and also to put on community money pool.

- Benefit that not-rich clients get
Clients with ideas but no funds yet can post projects on our platform and get help from developers.
Nowadays, open source developers does not get anything from open-source contribution or they are doing this as their fun or for something behind it.
But if we give reputation to open-source contributers and if this increase the possibility of getting jobs, more developers will come to our platform.
So clients with ideas can get benefit from our community.
